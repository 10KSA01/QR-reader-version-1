# QR-reader-version-1
Java program that runs a python script that reads QR codes.

The python script is based of a guide, with some minor changes. The link is provided below:
https://core-electronics.com.au/guides/raspberry-pi/QR-codes-raspberry-pi/

Reader.java uses the script.py whereas Reader2.java uses the script2.py. The difference between them is that the Reader2 does not output error lines, does not print out repeated data. 

This project was used with another project.

OpenCV needs to be installed for this project to work.
